Campbell systematic reviews present a quality comprehensive overview of the available evidence
both through the quality of the methods involved and by following strict editorial guidelines. Just as
authors seek to reduce bias at each stage of the review process, so too does the editorial board by
not relying on one peer reviewer for Campbell protocols and reviews.
Peer review assesses the quality of a systematic review before it is published through the Campbell
Collaboration website/ Wiley. Campbell systematic reviews go through rigorous peer-review usually
involving two content experts, one information retrieval expert, one method expert, and the
editorial team who will liaise directly with the review authors.
Search peer- review
The search strategy is an important part of a systematic review as the conclusions drawn are based
on the included body of evidence. Therefore, it is imperative that an expert in the science of
information retrieval ensures that each search strategy published in Campbell reviews is of a
consistently high standard and free from bias.
Submitted protocols and reviews will be reviewed by one information retrieval expert who is asked
to evaluate whether the search strategies employed are sound and coherent to fulfil the research
objectives. Information retrieval experts should also assess whether the review duplicates already
published work and whether the search methods are sufficiently clear for publication. The search
retrieval expert should then feed this back to the editors who will reach a final decision to reject,
revise and resubmit (minor or major), or accept.
Guidance and documents
Information retrieval specialists should first read and understand three important documents when
completing a peer review of search methods.
1. Searching for studies: a guide to information retrieval for Campbell systematic reviews
2. the Methodological expectations of Campbell Collaboration intervention reviews: Conduct
standards
3. Methodological expectations of Campbell Collaboration intervention reviews: Reporting
standards
Finally, search strategies for Campbell reviews should be appraised using the checklist attached to
the end of this document. This document is currently being updated by Campbellâ€™s Information
Retrieval Methods Group. However, search peer-reviewers should continue to use the older
checklist until the update is complete.
