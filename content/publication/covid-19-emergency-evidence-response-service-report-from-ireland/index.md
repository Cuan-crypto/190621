abstract: |-
  Evidence Synthesis Ireland (evidencesynthesisireland.ie), Cochrane
  Ireland (ireland.cochrane.org), and the Health Research Board
  Trials Methodology Research Network (hrb-tmrn.ie), were asked by
  the Irish Department of Health to focus our collective resources on
  prioritised evidence gaps for COVID-19 to support healthcare policy
  and practice decision-making. We harnessed existing connections
  and developed new collaborations with international colleagues
  and organisations to reduce duplication of e!ort, minimize research
  waste, share information, and ensure continued capacity building.
  The group, called the Emergency Evidence Response Service (EERS)
  worked quickly and flexibly on relevant questions that the World
  Health Organization (WHO), Cochrane, and ministries of health
  prioritized to be addressed using evidence synthesis skills.
  The core EERS team, which was established at the National
  University of Ireland Galway (nuigalway.ie) on 15 March 2020,
  worked across more than 25 projects to address COVID-19 evidence
  gaps including infection prevention and control, impacts on
  healthcare and mental health, as well as supporting evidence
  dissemination, education, and advocacy.
