  Early in the pandemic, as scientific reports and preliminary research on both
  clinical and public health aspects

  of COVID-19 were rapidly generated, we recognised the need for a dynamic, interactive tool that could capture

  and collate emerging evidence sources to inform research and decision-making efforts. In particular, we observed

  that numerous similar research efforts across the globe were happening in parallel - prompting an urgent need to

  connect research teams with each other and maximize research efficiency. Our colleagues in China provided daily

  translations of emerging evidence to aid networking between research groups working across the world. Here we

  describe how the meta-evidence project met daily and ongoing challenges and what was learned as a result. We

  describe the benefit of finding ways to instead work with better resourced teams and promote collective and open

  efforts to synthesise the evidence, which in the end, outweighed the considerable costs.
