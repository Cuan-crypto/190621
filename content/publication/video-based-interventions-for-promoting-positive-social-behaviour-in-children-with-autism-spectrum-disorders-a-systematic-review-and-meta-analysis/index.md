abstract: "This is the protocol for a Campbell review. The primary objective for
  this review is summarising the effectiveness of VBI in promoting prosocial
  behaviours in a population of young people with ASD. The research questions
  employed to fulfil this objective include: (1) Do VBI improve prosocial
  behaviours in children with ASD? (2) Which social skills and interactive
  behaviours are most successful? (3) Do VBI generally have successful rates of
  skill generalisation and response maintenance? (4) Do demographic
  characteristics (age, gender) of participants influence the effectiveness of
  VBI's?"
