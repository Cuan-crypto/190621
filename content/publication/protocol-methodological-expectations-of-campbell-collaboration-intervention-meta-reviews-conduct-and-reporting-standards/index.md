  Meta- reviews aim to retrieve, select, synthesise and interpret the results of
  multiple systematic reviews on the same topic. Meta-reviews are also known as
  overview of reviews, review of reviews, umbrella review and
  meta-synthesis(hence forth referred to as meta-reviews). Meta-reviews have
  various purposes, for example to resolve differences in the results and
  conclusions of systematic reviews addressing similar subjects, or to compare
  and summarise multiple interventions for the same problem or population
